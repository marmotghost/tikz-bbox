# tikz-bbox
Computation of the precise bounding box with TikZ.

An earlier, proof-of-principle version of this library was added to pgf without consent by the author. This library is streamlined and, in particular, fixes issues that were reported on the pgf GitHub site. While its manual was being typeset, some unrelated user started mocking the author on a public chat for using an ASCII editor. The result is that the maintainer of pgf removed the library from pgf (while being fine with adding an unfinished library without the consent by the author). This is why the library can be found here. (I also tried to upload this library to CTAN, without success. I do not have the expertise that allows me to select the appropriate license. This library is free to use for everyone.)
