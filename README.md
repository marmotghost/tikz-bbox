An earlier, proof-of-principle version of this library was added to pgf without me explicitly agreeing to this. (A pgf maintainer insists that, since I did not add a license, they had the right to add the library to pgf. This may well be the case, I am not an expert on this, all I am saying is that [I was stressing that at that stage it was just a proof of principle](https://github.com/pgf-tikz/pgf/pull/714#issuecomment-513228203) and never agreed in any way that this library become a part of the public pgf package.) On the other hand, as opposed to the library that was part of pgf, this version of the library is streamlined and, in particular, fixes issues that were reported on the pgf GitHub site. While its manual was being typeset, some unrelated user started mocking the author on a public chat for using an ASCII editor. The result is that the maintainer of pgf removed the library from pgf. This is why the library can be found here. (I also tried to upload this library to CTAN, without success. However, if someone wants to upload it, I'd have no objections, I just do not have any experience in submitting things to CTAN.)
