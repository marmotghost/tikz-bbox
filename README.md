Computation of the precise bounding box with TikZ.

An earlier, proof-of-principle version of this library was added to pgf without me explicitly agreeing to this. (A pgf maintainer insists that, since I did not add a license, they had the right to add the library to pgf. This may well be the case, I am not an expert on this, all I am saying is that [I was stressing that at that stage it was just a proof of principle](https://github.com/pgf-tikz/pgf/pull/714#issuecomment-513228203) and never agreed in any way that this library become a part of the public pgf package.) On the other hand, as opposed to the library that was part of pgf, this version of the library is streamlined and, in particular, fixes issues that were reported on the pgf GitHub site. While its manual was being typeset, some unrelated user started mocking the author on a public chat for using an ASCII editor. The result is that the maintainer of pgf removed the library from pgf. (They claim that [I had changed the license](https://tug.org/pipermail/pgf-tikz/2020q3/000035.html). This claim is a lie. Be it as it may, users will now have to make some in principle unnecessary efforts to get the correct bounding box, and all I can say is that I am not resposible for these senseless complications.) This is why the library can be found here. (I also tried to upload this library to CTAN, without success. However, if someone wants to upload it, I'd have no objections, I just do not have any experience in submitting things to CTAN.)

A side remark concerns other applications of this library, and the routines contained. It can conceivably be used to speed up the determination of intersections. Why? A path is a collection of cubic Bézier curves. (Straight lines and quadratic Bézier curves are special cases of cubic Bézier curves.) A segment in path A can intersect with a segment of path B if the intersections of the bounding boxes of the segments is nonempty.
